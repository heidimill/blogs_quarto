## Explore a marimo based post

This repository provides a framework for integrating
[](https://quarto.org) with [](https://marimo.io),
enabling markdown documents to be executed in a  environment, and
reactive in page.

```{python.marimo}
import marimo as mo
```

```{python.marimo}
slider = mo.ui.slider(start=1, stop=10)
slider
```

```{python.marimo}
#| echo: true
mo.md(f'''
  # Hello from marimo!{'!' * slider.value}

  This is a raw, reactive python cell.
  You can edit it, and the output will change on run.
''').callout("info")
```
